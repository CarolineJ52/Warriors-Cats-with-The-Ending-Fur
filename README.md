*Note: I used Vicky as a source for confirming eye color. If Vicky didn't confirm an eye color, I just commented on what the Warrior Wiki had as colors for those specific cats in the undetermined/not mentioned section.*

*Second Note: Warriors Cats also has a ton of mistakes, so this list might have eye colors or pelt colors that could always be deconfirmed or changed later.* 

*Third Note: Some cats sporting two different sets of eye colors are also in the undetermined section because I am unsure which is the confirmed eye color.*
