# Cats With Orange Eyes
Mintfur-a light gray tabby tom. Mintfur was a RiverClan warrior under Leopardstar and Mistystar's leadership. He is mates with Icewing and participated in the Great Battle. It is presumed Mintfur died before the Lost Stars book, which is the first book in The Broken Code series. He and his mate, Icewing, were tortured by Darktail and his Kin after the death of Petalfur, their daughter; Darktail took over RiverClan and held them hostage. He returned after Mistystar reclaimed her clan. He later died of an illness. Four of his six kits are dead, and two of them have no known StarClan residence, Beetlewhisker and Petalfur.

Cinderfur-a scarred, thin gray tom. Cinderfur was ShadowClan deputy under the short leadership of Nightstar. Both he and Nightstar died of Carrionplace disease. Both he and Nightstar were brought out of retirement to lead the clan. He was exhiled along with the rest of the elders when Brokenstar was leader. Cinderfur was the first cat to get ill from the Carrionplace disease. Both he and Nightstar tried to bring ShadowClan back from the dark past of Brokenstar's leadership, but failed due to StarClan's refusal since Brokenstar was still alive.
